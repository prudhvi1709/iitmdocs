# Changes in project grading (wef now) and Eligibility to enter the BSc Level (wef May 2024)

## 1. Project grading:

So far - students had to complete all feature requirements given for a project, pass the L1 viva and move onto the L2 viva and pass that too to get a pass grade.

Looking into the data we have, we understand that all students may not be equally proficient in the areas of programming, machine learning and business and excel in all 4 projects.

Hence the grading is being changed as follows:

**MAD1, MAD2, MLP projects: WEF current term**

- For MAD1 and MAD2 projects, when the submitted Application passes the check for Appdev, L1 viva will be scheduled.
- For MLP project, if the cutoff is crossed in the Kaggle contest and the student declares that all the models have been completed, the L1 viva is scheduled.

There are 2 cutoff marks that will be decided for the L1 level for each term:  
**Cutoff1: X, Cutoff2: Y;**  
**X < Y, X > 0**

The L1 viva will be conducted and scoring will be done based on the rubrics defined for it. Based on the marks scored in L1 viva (L1_S), the following are the possibilities:

- If (L1_S < X): Student has to resubmit the project. A few days are given for them to resubmit in the same term. If the second time also, L1_S < X, they will have to redo the project in the next term.
- If (X ≤ L1_S < Y): Students are asked some additional questions for assessing their knowledge and awarded D or E grade. Such students do not go in for L2 viva at all. They will have a pass grade.
- If (L1_S ≥ Y): L2 viva is scheduled for them.
  - If they pass the viva cutoff for L2, they get a grade including L1 and L2 scores.
  - If they do not pass the L2 viva cutoff, they get one more chance at L2 viva.
  - If they do not pass in the second attempt at L2 viva, they get an appropriate grade (C or D or E) based on their L1 performance alone.

**BDM project evaluation**

**So far:**  
The process has been identifying the business, collecting data, analysing and sharing their insights.

**Going forward from Jan 2024:**  
Students will be allowed to web scrape data and analyse it, sharing the source from where the data was taken. The BDM team will outline the steps involved.  
**The maximum grade that the student can earn in this case will be D.**

### 2. Eligibility for entering degree level of the program: WEF May 2024

For a student to progress to the degree level (BSc) of the Data Science and Applications program:

- they must secure a **CGPA of 6.0 or higher at the end of two diplomas** (includes the courses in the foundation level and the diploma level and the projects)  
**AND**  
- a **CGPA of 7.0 or higher in all the projects completed at the diploma level.**

These CGPA requirements are **not applicable** to students who exit the program with the diploma(s).  
Such students who exit the program with the diploma(s) without meeting either CGPA criteria will **not be eligible** for any certificates of academic achievements or prizes.

- Students can repeat the theory courses any number of times within the stipulated period for diploma level to improve the overall CGPA.
- Students who have overall CGPA of 6.0 or above and CGPA < 7.0 in projects, which prevents them from entering the degree level, will be given **one additional opportunity** to improve their project grades to earn the eligibility to progress to the degree level.
- Students who cannot improve their CGPA above the required cut-offs must exit the program with the diploma(s).

**This rule shall be applicable to all students entering the degree level (BSc) from the May 2024 term.**

- For those students who completed diplomas with less than 4 standalone projects (in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms projects were included in theory courses), whatever projects were done standalone will be counted for the average CGPA of 7.0.
  - For example, if 2 projects were done as part of the theory and 2 projects standalone, then only the grades in the two standalone projects will be used to compute the project CGPA.  
    The projects done as part of the theory courses will not be counted.

**For those who do 4 standalone projects, eligibility to enter degree level is illustrated below with some examples:**

| P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | Total points | Eligible to enter the degree level? |
|----|----|----|----|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| E  | E  | S  | S  | 28            | Yes                                  |
| E  | E  | S  | A  | 27            | No                                   |
| D  | E  | S  | S/A/B | 30/29/28  | Yes                                  |
| D  | D  | S/A/B | S/A/B | 28-32  | Yes                                  |
| D  | D  | C  | C  | 26            | No                                   |

For those who have the foundations to enter the Diploma programme directly and those who wish to do just the Diploma and exit with it, this is a pathway. It is primarily aimed at working professionals or learners who already possess the fundamentals taught in Year 1 of this programme to enter the Diploma level directly.


**Entry - Into Diploma level**

**Exit - One or both Diplomas from IIT Madras**

### 8.1  Eligibility to Apply
Students who have completed 2 years in any UG degree programme are permitted to apply to the diploma level through direct entry. Their second year marksheet or higher must be submitted as proof to qualify under this category.

### 8.2 Qualifying Process
- A separate Direct Admission to Diploma (DAD) qualifier exam will be conducted for the Diploma in programming (DP) and Diploma in Data Science (DS).
- These are conducted on the same date as the end term examinations of the IITM BS DS program. Hence these are conducted three times a year.
- Any candidate crossing the cut off marks defined below will be eligible to enter the Diploma Programme corresponding to the qualifier attempted and register to the courses.
- There will be no limit on the number of attempts by any candidate for direct entry, though the recommendation would be that if they do not pass the qualifier, they attempt through the foundation level.
- The qualifier for DAD-DP will be a 3 hr exam, subjects being English, Aptitude and 6 weeks of Maths 1. Students have to study Computational Thinking, Introduction to Python and then move on to the Programming Diploma subjects.
- The qualifier exam for the DAD-DS will be a 4 hr exam, with subjects being English, Maths 1, Statistics 1 and Python programming. Students have to start with Maths 2 and Statistics 2 and then continue with subjects in the Data Science diploma.

Students who have completed the Diploma in Data Science by Direct admission are directly eligible to also pursue the Diploma in Programming, if they wish to, without attempting the qualifier exam for this.

But students who complete the Diploma in Programming and wish to pursue the Diploma in Data Science have to appear for the qualifier for DS as they would not have studied Statistics 1 and Maths 1 as part of course work.

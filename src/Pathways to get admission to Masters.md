## Get a GATE score/rank and apply to IITM’s MTech/MS or PhD programs (Campus program)

- Writing the GATE exam opens doors to you at 100s of institutes and not just IITM.
- Using the GATE score, you can apply for an MTech or MS or PhD depending on what other degree you have apart from the BS degree.
- You will get a stipend from the institute if you join the MTech (HTTA) /MS or PhD program.  
- This is our most recommended option for all students as the GATE score also enables you to apply to PSU jobs.

## e. Upgrade to a PG Diploma or MTech degree online after the BS

- Once a student has completed 142 credits and the BS degree, they can choose to continue to study more courses. If they complete 20 more credits (3 core and 2 elective courses), students will be awarded a PG Diploma.
- If they continue to do a project of 20 credits, they can earn an MTech from IIT Madras.

i. This option to upgrade to the PGD or MTech can be exercised at any time after they complete 106 credits until they complete 142 credits.  
ii. The CGPA cutoff required in the BS program for applying for this upgrade is 8.00.  
iii. This option is recommended for working professionals who cannot afford to leave their jobs and join a physical college for a Masters degree.  
We strongly recommend that standalone students, who have joined the BS program after std XII to write the GATE exam and join a college for their Masters and not take this Option.

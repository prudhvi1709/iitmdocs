# Apprenticeship in the BS level of IIT Madras’ BS in Data Science and 

The program provides the students in the BS level of the program to pursue an apprenticeship with companies and research projects and earn up to 12 credits in this level. Doing an apprenticeship is optional.

## Steps involved in the Apprenticeship program:

- **Approval for the company/research project where the student can work as an apprentice**  
  If the student applies and is accepted by any of the companies that are preapproved by IITM for this purpose, the apprenticeship will be directly approved.  
  Else the student will have to submit the details of the company/organization and the Apprenticeship committee will decide based on the details submitted.

- **Reporting Manager**  
  Once the apprenticeship is approved, the student has to submit the details of the Reporting Manager in the Organization to IITM.

- **Logging the weekly work report**  
  Student has to file the work log to IITM BS office every week.

- **Review after first 4 weeks**  
  After 4 weeks, based on the student’s performance, the reporting manager has to confirm if they would like to continue with the student as an apprentice for the next 7 months. This confirmation letter should be submitted to the IITM BS Program’s Office.

- **Possible exit after 4 months**  
  After the completion of 4 months, the student or the company can choose to discontinue the apprenticeship. A letter from the company has to be submitted outlining the work done by the student and whether it was satisfactory to obtain partial credits.

- **After the completion of 8 months of internship**  
  A letter from the Reporting Manager should be submitted to the IITM BS program on the company’s letterhead stating the work done by the student and whether it was satisfactory.

## 8\. Database management system (DBMS) - Diploma in Programming

Quiz 1: July 13 2025                           Quiz 2: August 03 2025                End term:  August 31 2025

Above to be attended in person at designated centres.

Eligibility to write end term exam: Average of the best 5 out of the first 7 weekly assessments scores >= 40/100 and attending at least one of the 2 quizzes in the centre

Eligibility to get final course grade:

Attending the End sem exam AND scoring a minimum of 35% in the OPE (overall) AND Getting the question based on Python-DB connectivity correct is mandatory to get the course grade.

(The OPE will be based on SQL query(Week 2-3) and Python-Database connectivity(Week 7).)

If you don't get the 35% in OPE OR don't pass the Python-DB connectivity question, you will be given Fail in the OPE.)

OPPE:

Student has to complete the OPPE System Compatibility Test (SCT) exam

SoP for the SCT Exam is as follows: [Click Here for OPPE SCT SoP Document](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3he8zy9_kHEnVunxANLXW_eCKuUk4dPpr1zqeyVH69rJgv9eaHNiOiyKMtvY20nAxG5TFvjSSOiDL/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1753945279220579&usg=AOvVaw01npa6LfmIeiwF7mKgDW8F)

There is only one OPPE conducted for the course. But there are 2 chances to attempt it.

- Students have to mandatorily attend the OPPE on the first date. If you fail in this, you get a chance to reappear the next weekend. So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
- If you are absent on the first date, you do not get the reattempt chance.
- If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.

The calculation of Final course Score is proposed as follows:

GAA1 = Average score in First 10 weekly graded assignments

GAA2= Average score of week 2 and 3 SQL based assignments

GAA3= Average score of week 7 programming assignment

Qz1 = score in Quiz I (0, if not attempted)

Qz2 = score in Quiz II (0, if not attempted)

OPE - Score in online remote proctored programming exam

F = score in final exam

Overall score for eligible students:

T = 0.04GAA1 + 0.03GAA2 + 0.03GAA3 + 0.2OP + max (0.45F+0.15max(Qz1, Qz2),  0.4F+(0.10Qz1+0.20Qz2 ))

Will be conducted in the course VM - Each BPT has 4 Questions

Eligibility to attend the end term exam:

Average of the best 5 out of the first 7 weekly assessments (objective and programming) scores >= 40/100

Eligibility to get the course grade:

Attending the end semester exam AND

programming exam (OPPE) with a score >= 40/100

Eligibility for OPPE: The average of the first three BPT >=40

SCT for OPPE and exam day rules:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13WhnPprgKrgMfJ-Ep9IJQdolharbkY4ucrrfQYVoe4c/pub#h.t5nwrevshz0a](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3he8zy9_kHEnVunxANLXW_eCKuUk4dPpr1zqeyVH69rJgv9eaHNiOiyKMtvY20nAxG5TFvjSSOiDL/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1753945279269070&usg=AOvVaw0skRWhVvKLtUmIlMlNsWBg)

We are NOT going to have 2 OPPEs going forward. It is going to be ONE OPPE based on weeks 1-9.

Students have to mandatorily attend the OPPE on the first date.

- If you fail in this, you get a chance to reappear the next weekend. So you get 2 chances to attempt the exam.
- If the first date is inconvenient due to a clash with some other engagement, then you can apply for a postponement to the second date providing sufficient proof. If this is accepted, your exam will be moved to the second date but if you fail in this, you will not get another chance to reattempt. You will have to do it in the subsequent term.
- If you are absent on 16th Aug, you DON'T get another chance on 24th aug.

NPPE \[Syllabus Weeks 1-9\]:08th Aug 2025 (This will give you practice to handle the OPE, but not part of final course grade)

GAA = Average of score in Best 9 out of the 10 weekly graded assignments

BPTA: Average of the 4 BPT scores

QZ1 = score in Quiz I (0, if not attempted)

OPE = Score in online remote proctored programming exam

F = score in End Term exam

Final course score T \= 0.10 GAA + 0.2 Qz1 + 0.3 OPE + 0.3 F + 0.1 BPTA

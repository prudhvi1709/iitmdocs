Prize Eligibility Criteria for Improvement Courses


For the prizes awarded after the diploma level, we will consider the CGPA only till the term when the student completes the two diplomas. Improvements in foundational/diploma courses done after completion of both diplomas will not be considered for the diploma-level prizes. For example, if a student had repeated a foundation/diploma course for improvement in September 2023 but had completed both diplomas in May 2023, then the CGPA secured in May 2023 will be considered for diploma-level prize. Diploma-level prizes will not be given retrospectively.


Certificate of Merit and Distinction Policy


Students eligible for a Certificate of Merit or Distinction must maintain a clean academic and disciplinary record. Any instance of academic malpractice or disciplinary violation in a student's history will result in disqualification from receiving the certificate, irrespective of academic performance.

# New Rules for Foundation & Diploma Level Completion

### 18.1 Foundation level checkpoints:

These conditions shall be applicable to the students admitted to the foundation level from May 2024. These are not applicable for students who have entered in Jan 2024 term or before that. But completing the foundation level in 9 terms is applicable for all.

Students will be removed from the program if they do not complete

- at least 4 courses within 4 terms.
- at least 6 courses within 6 terms.
- the 8 foundation courses within 9 terms.

The student will be issued warnings about insufficient progress and about complying with these conditions starting from term 3.

### 18.2 Change in CCC at the foundation level:

This is for ALL students in the foundation level.

Currently, the CCC is calculated based on the courses passed in the last 2 terms by the students and enforced too, deciding the number of courses that students can take in a given term in the Foundation Level.

In view of the conditions imposed above leading to exit from the program if not satisfied, it was proposed that the CCC will only be a recommendation and not enforced. This will enable students to make up for term breaks and meet the proposed course completion criteria.

### 18.3 Increasing the maximum number of terms for completing the diploma level

The Diploma level can now be completed in a maximum of 12 terms instead of 9 terms as has been the case till now. This extension of 12 terms as the maximum limit to complete the Diploma level shall be applied for all learners, starting from the first batch, who started the Diploma Level in September 2021.

The maximum duration for the BSc and BS levels shall remain unchanged at 9 terms. The total duration permissible for the BSc and BS degrees shall also remain at 6 and 8 years, respectively.

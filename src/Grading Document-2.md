# Bonus Marks

Bonus Marks are for encouraging and incentivising the students to participate more in the activities of the course.

These marks will be added ONLY for the students who pass the course and will only impact the course grade, and not the pass criteria. Criteria for bonus marks:

Marks will be applicable based on availability of mock activities in the course. It can vary from course to course and can range from 0-2.

- If the average of the marks obtained in all the mock tests conducted before Quiz 1 & Quiz 2 >= 40/100, students will get 2 marks. The mock tests have to be done within the time specified.
- The course team may set up additional activities in the course which will be eligible for upto 3 bonus marks. If no additional activities are set up, this bonus won't be applicable.

# Information about course grades:

S,A,B,C,D,E - Pass grade; U/WA/WQ - Fail grade   I - Incomplete

In I grade - there are 3 types:

1.  If you are absent for ET alone with all other assessment components completed (quizzes, OPPEs, project, weekly assignments) - grade will be pushed as I.

Options: You can register to take up ET exam alone in the subsequent term. OPPE and quizzes will not be scheduled for you. All other marks for Final course score will be taken from the previous run.

2.  If you have failed in the OPPE but wrote the ET exam and crossed the cutoff for T as given in the course grading policy, grade = I_OP.

You can register to do the OPPE alone whereby if the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You can attempt the OPPE alone. All other mark components of FInal course score will be taken from the previous run. ET and quizzes will not be scheduled for you.

3.  If you have failed in the OPPE and absent for ET, then grade = I_BOTH

You can register to ET and OPPEs alone. If the course has one OPPE, that will be scheduled. If the course has 2 OPPEs, both will be scheduled for you. You will attempt the ET and OPPEs. Quiz and GAA and other components will be taken from the previous run and not scheduled.

In all the above cases, you can also choose to Repeat the entire course and not just do the ET/OPPE alone if you want to reattempt all assessment components.

# Suggested pathway to register and study Foundation level courses:

For those entering Foundation Level in MAY 2024 or after, kindly go through the new rules: 4/6/8 courses to be completed in 4/6/9 terms. Else you will be removed from the program.

Academic policies:

1\. In each programming assignment, be it any course or any OPPE,  taking help from LLMs (e.g. ChatGPT, Gemini) partially or completely is considered plagiarism.

2\. Unless explicitly permitted, do not use LLMs. Using LLMs is considered a violation of honour code.

3\. Students can discuss and learn from each other but the assignments are expected to be done individually based on their understanding.

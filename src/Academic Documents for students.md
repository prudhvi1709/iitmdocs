## 14.1 Types of documents
There will be 2 types of documents that will be made available automatically.

### Term wise Progress card
This document will list all the courses taken by the learner term wise.

The values for every course will be:
* course code
* course name
* level
* grade obtained

> Note that the transcript will show all attempts and grades obtained in each of the attempts.

### Grade Card
This will have the courses at each level listed only once. The best score obtained among all attempts for each course is what will be shown here.

GPA will be calculated for the courses in a particular term of the programme.

$$GPA = \frac{\sum (GP_i \cdot C_i)}{\sum C_i}$$

Where $GP_i$ = grade point of a course and $C_i$ is the number of credits assigned to that course and $\sum C_i$ is the total number of credits of all courses in the term, including those with U or W grades.

The CGPA will also be computed for all unique courses completed until this point in time with the best grade being considered in case a course is attempted multiple times.

## 14.3 Policy on Advanced Certificate for Diploma Level Students
*[Updated on Jul 18, 2025]*

### 14.3.1 Policy on Advanced Certificate
To address the situation where Diploma-level students exit the program without completing their projects and thus receive no certification for their completed coursework, we are now offering an "Advanced Certificate" for those who successfully complete the theoretical components of the Diploma.

The Advanced Certificate will be given to those Students who are at the Diploma level and have completed all six theory courses in either or both Diplomas, but have completed only one of the two required projects (or have both projects pending). The certificate will be provided to all the eligible students.

The Advanced Certificate will be given by default to ALL students who complete the required theory courses at the Diploma level. The Advanced Certificate will be made available in the Student Dashboard.

### 14.3.2 The Advanced Certificate will be awarded as:
* **Diploma in Programming** - Advanced Certificate in Programming and Application Development
* **Diploma in Data Science** - Advanced Certificate in Machine Learning and Data Science

### 14.3.3 Eligibility Criteria
* Students who have completed all 6 theory courses of the Diploma in Programming, with one or both projects pending, will be awarded the Advanced Certificate in Programming and Application Development.
* Students who have completed all 6 theory courses of the Diploma in Data Science, with one or both projects pending, will be awarded the Advanced Certificate in Machine Learning and Data Science.

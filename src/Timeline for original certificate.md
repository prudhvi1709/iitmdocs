We need to get the senate approval before generating the original certificate. Senate meetings will be conducted three or four times in a year. Please refer the below timeline for certificate issue date.

> **Note:** Students who have completed the BSc and BS degree and wish to take their original certificate have to **mandatorily register with the IITM Alumni Association**, pay the fees of **Rs 6000/-**, and confirm to the BS team. Only after this will the original certificate be processed.

### Important Points to be remembered:

Original certificate will be processed only if the below criteria are satisfied:

1. Required credits completed with all the Mandatory courses in Degree Level.
2. Exit form has to be filled by the Student with a **handwritten document** and a proper **professional photograph with a blue background**.
3. Minimum duration of:
   - **3 years (9 terms)** for BSc
   - **4 years (12 terms)** for BS  
   should be completed from the first term of starting the program.

#### For Eg:

- **21f1’s** will complete 4 years in **24f3 (end of the Sep Term)** – BS Certificates can be processed if (1) & (2) above are satisfied from **Jan 2025** onwards.
- **21f3’s** will complete 4 years in **25f2 (end of May Term)** – hence OC shall be processed at the end of **25f2 only** – which will be **after September 2025**.

**Same applies for BSc with 3 years completion criteria.**

## Timelines (Appdev1, Appdev2 & MLP, BDM projects):

Here are the timelines for students doing projects in the MAY 2025 terms who will be entering Degree level in the Sep 2025 term. Without completing the 12 courses and 4 projects, you cannot start degree level courses from Sep 2025 onwards.

For entering the Degree level in Sep 2025, you have  to complete ALL projects and vivas by August 2025. \`

BDM project final submission has to be done and approved by May/June/July/August 2025 so that viva can be over in May/June/July/August 2025. Project grade for all the courses will be pushed on/before Sep 7th.

Very important: [Viva](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT1g_NCl-ut6ET-z6nXK_UrdG2QmBOT6dNsMy0EIiho78paPDXm0-kjgot9IZC2s4ZAEKh-bC7MKWJ5/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1753945279301336&usg=AOvVaw1vJCPS_OK4O9l3Xr1qtaP2)[policies](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT1g_NCl-ut6ET-z6nXK_UrdG2QmBOT6dNsMy0EIiho78paPDXm0-kjgot9IZC2s4ZAEKh-bC7MKWJ5/pub&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1753945279301600&usg=AOvVaw2VMBizc5fqYd7Oo_sPckHm)

Students who completed App dev1, App dev2, MLP and BDM in Sep 2021/Jan 2022 terms:

If you complete the 6 courses and 2 projects of any of the two Diplomas, you will get the Diploma certificates. But your credits will not be 27 for this Diploma but 23 or 25 depending on how many of these courses were completed in these 2 terms. The projects done as part of the courses of Sep 2021/Jan 2022 will not get the 2 credits. So there is no issue with the Diploma level.

When you come to the BSc level, 114 credits are required to obtain the BSc certificate. Hence this deficit of 2/4/6/8 credits will have to be made up by taking more elective courses offered by the IITM BS program.

# Degree Level courses

All 8 credits can be earned from IITM BS courses or NPTEL (maximum upto 4 credits from [Table 2](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/174jYHwLzKqKyPnCQoF_l7JJROLRbQALIsi_HnaWgahs/edit%23heading%3Dh.1fob9te&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1753945279304455&usg=AOvVaw1ltztYprA65BgIAY62rBfV)) or if there is an option to credit campus courses (IITM or other institutes), that too can be done.

This will be implemented wef Sep 2023 for the batch that enters the degree level in Sep 2023.

We are also collaborating with the Microsoft and AWS certification program team to offer their courses for our students at discounted rates. Would be good to complete some cloud certifications from this too when we offer it.

It is important you learn more on programming and data science outside of what the curriculum offers and strengthen your resume.

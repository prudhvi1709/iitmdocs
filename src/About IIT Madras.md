## About IIT Madras

Indian Institute of Technology Madras is one of the foremost institutes of national importance for higher
technical education and research.

In 1956, the German Government offered technical assistance in establishing an institute of higher education in
engineering in India. The first Indo-German agreement in Bonn, West Germany for the establishment of the Indian
Institute of Technology at Madras was signed in 1959.

The Institute was formally inaugurated in 1959 by Prof. Humayun Kabir, Union Minister for Scientific Research
and Cultural Affairs. The IIT system has twenty three Institutes of Technology. The first of these to be
instituted are at Kharagpur (estb. 1951), Mumbai (estb. 1958), Chennai (estb. 1959), Kanpur (estb. 1959), Delhi
(estb. 1961), Guwahati (estb. 1994) and Roorkee (estb. 1847, joined IITs in 2001).

The Institute has sixteen academic departments and several advanced research centres in various disciplines of
engineering and pure sciences. A faculty of international repute, a brilliant student community, excellent
technical & supporting staff and an effective administration have all contributed to the pre-eminent status of
IIT Madras. The campus is located in the city of Chennai, previously known as Madras. Chennai is the state
capital of Tamil Nadu, a southern state in India.

## IITM’s Experience in Online Education

IITM is well-equipped to provide an online degree course. We have been ranked number 1 Engineering Institute for
the past 5 years and we have been ranked number 1 Overall for the past 2 years by NIRF.

Furthermore, IITM began the NPTEL program, the country’s first online content portal as an inter-IIT consortium
project in 2001 and
[nptel.ac.in](https://www.nptel.ac.in) is one of the largest online course portals in
the world. In 2014, IITM also created NPTEL online courses - the country’s first Massive Open Online Course
(MOOC). Today, NPTEL is considered the largest MOOC provider in India.

MHRD launched the SWAYAM MOOC platform in 2017 and NPTEL has been the largest contributor to it. NPTEL also
manages the national MOOCs portal -
[swayam.gov.in](https://www.swayam.gov.in)
as well as the network of more than 3800 SWAYAM local chapter colleges. With IITM continuing to lead the NPTEL
project, it makes them the perfect choice to offer an online degree program.

Why an Online Degree Initiative? 

IIT Madras wishes to reach out to the many aspiring and motivated learners across India. An online degree is the
perfect way to accomplish this, as it is not limited by on-campus physical infrastructure.

Being an online program, we can accommodate between 50,000 to a lakh learners per batch.

It is a game changer as
working professionals, and learners of any age group
can enroll in it.

Students currently enrolled in a physical college in any program can join here and
 earn their second degree. (University Grants Commission had
announced in 2020 that students will now be permitted to pursue two degree programs simultaneously if one is
in online mode)

Since there are
no restrictions on the base subjects, students from other streams such as commerce / arts / law
and of course, science students can enroll in this program. Data Science and Machine Learning is proving to be
useful in all disciplines and fields.

All courses will be offered 3 times a year. Thus, learners have
 considerable flexibility in the pace they can select
to move ahead in the program.

The program gives
flexibility to learners to set their goals. Learners who
successfully complete all 8 courses in Foundational Level can get a certificate and exit. Alternatively, they
can proceed to do the more specialised courses in the Diploma Level and exit with a Diploma in Programming
AND/OR Diploma in Data Science from IIT Madras. However, those interested in acquiring the BS degree can
proceed to take up the Degree Level courses. Check the
[Academics](academics.html)
page for details. Based on their requirements, they can acquire certifications that will help them with better
employment opportunities.

The program will be rigorous in its delivery, just as any other
program from IIT Madras. Learners have to spend time with the coursework every week and achieve minimum
criteria to pass every course.

Being an online program, the
course content can be accessed by learners from anywhere. They
need to have a laptop / desktop, a good internet connection, and more importantly, the will to learn and work
hard. Learners will be required to travel to designated exam centres only for the quizzes and exams each term.
View section about
[exam cities](academics.html#AC9).

Each course will have a
discussion forum with an active academic team to help
in clearing doubts. We plan to bring in more personalised mentors to help students with Diploma Level and
Degree Level courses.

In future, we are considering
tie-ups with industries to enable internships and project opportunities. This will also facilitate hiring of our learners who perform well in the program.

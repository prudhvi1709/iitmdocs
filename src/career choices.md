# IITM’s BS in Data Science and Applications

# Career choices Report - April 2025

We see the students of this program pursuing a Masters/PhD program after completing the degree or they choose to enter the corporate world - either securing opportunities on their own (through their colleges and networks) or go through IITM's BS placement cell (IIC) for internships or placements.

1.  Self secured Internships and Jobs - As reported by the students

This information is submitted by the students through a survey during the BS program’s course registration. The data shown here accounts for only the students who declared that the knowledge obtained from the BS program and showcasing it on the resume helped them secure the internship/job. We find that a large fraction of the students are able to accomplish this on their own.

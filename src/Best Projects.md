### About Projects

  

* **Modern Application Development-1 (MAD-1)**  
  This project is the next step in applying the MAD-1 theory to real-world scenarios, providing students with valuable practical experience. The project involves building a multi-user application that requires students to work with various Python frameworks. One of the key requirements is to create secure login pages, either by utilizing a robust login framework or by designing a simple HTML form with a username and password.
  This project will expose students to Flask, a popular Python web application framework, and teach them how to use Jinja2 templates and Bootstrap to generate and style HTML. To store data, the project will make use of SQLite, a reliable database management system. Through this project, students will gain hands-on experience in building complex web applications using Python.

* **Modern Application Development-2 (MAD-2)**  
  This project represents the next step for students to gain practical experience in applying the MAD-2 theory to real-world scenarios. By leveraging their knowledge of Flask for API development, VueJS for UI design, and Jinja2 templates, along with Bootstrap for responsive design, SQLite for database management, and Redis for caching, students will gain valuable insights into the workings of these powerful frameworks.
  In addition, students will have the opportunity to work with advanced VueJS tools like CLI and incorporate Celery and Redis for batch jobs. Overall, this project will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of these popular Python frameworks and equip them with the skills necessary to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios.

* **Business Data Management (BDM)**  
  This course is the next step in the Business Data Management Theory curriculum, focusing on practical data handling skills. During the course, students will be tasked with collecting and working on data relevant to a business problem from various sectors, including organized and unorganized industries such as manufacturing, automobiles, IT, supermarkets, laundry, vegetable vendors, restaurants, and service businesses.
  Students will develop a deep understanding of the business domain, collect and clean relevant data, and conduct a thorough analysis to extract valuable insights. By working on this project, students will enhance their ability to drive business success through informed decision-making based on data analysis.

* **Machine Learning Practices (MLP)**  
  This project offers an excellent opportunity for students to apply theoretical Machine learning techniques to real-world scenarios, equipping them with valuable practical skills. During the project, students will learn how to utilize popular Python libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, imblearn, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Pickle, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
  By working with these libraries, students will gain hands-on experience in Python frameworks and equip them with the skills necessary to apply their knowledge in real-world scenarios and implementing machine learning algorithms, will help them develop a strong foundation in this exciting field.

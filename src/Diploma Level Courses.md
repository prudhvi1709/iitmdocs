# Diploma Level courses

## Suggested pathway to register and study Diploma level courses:

1.  Most aggressive pathway - completing in 4 terms - ONLY IF YOU ARE DOING THIS AS FULL TIME AND NOTHING ELSE AND CAN SPEND 70 HRs PER WEEK MINIMUM
2.  Comfortable pathway - 6 terms - 2 years : Suggested for students and working professionals doing this along with another degree or their job (40hrs/week)
3.  Those from non technical backgrounds, new to programming or have busy schedules, recommended to take 6 or 7 terms for the 2 diplomas.
4.  Same sequence of courses are suggested if you are taking only the Diploma in programming or Diploma in DS separately too.

Maximum number of terms to complete both Diplomas: 12

Even with a relaxed pathway, you should complete in a maximum of 7 or 8 terms.

The new rules for those entering Diploma Level from May 2024 onwards:

- Complete minimum of 3 courses and 1 project in every 3 terms, which means the

- The slowest you can go is 3 courses and 1 project in 3 terms (1 year), 6 courses and 2 projects in 6 terms (2 years), 9 courses and 3 projects in 9 terms (3 years) and 12 courses and 4 projects in 12 terms (4 years).

- At the end of 3 terms, if you do not complete 3 courses and 1 project you will be given warning. At the end of 6/9/12 terms if you do not complete 6/9/12 courses and 2/3/4 projects, you will be removed from the program.

If you wish to do the Diploma in programming and Diploma in data science one after the other and not mix up the courses, here are the suggested pathways.

IMPORTANT

1.  OPPEs for all Diploma courses will be scheduled in the following way:

1.  If you have 2 courses with OPPEs, both will be scheduled on 17th Aug                                .
1.  If you have 3 courses with OPPEs, OPPEs for 2 courses will be scheduled on 17th Aug  and OPPE for 1 course will be scheduled on 24th Aug                                                                        .
1.  If you have 4 courses with OPPEs, OPPEs for 2 courses will be scheduled on  17th Aug and OPPE for the other 2 courses will be scheduled on 24th Aug

In the cases of b and c above, if you fail or are absent in subjects of 16 August and are rescheduled for 24 August, there will be no option to split the subjects any further or reschedule them. All will have to be written on the same day.

Only if you have a conflicting engagement on 16th Aug, which cannot be changed or moved and you submit a request to us with proof, we will check the proofs and if found valid, we will make changes to the above allocation.

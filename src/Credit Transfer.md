### Credit Transfer for NPTEL Courses

- The following process is to be followed for credit transfer from NPTEL:
  - An NPTEL course of duration 4/8/12 weeks carries credit equivalence of 1/2/3 credits in the BS degree program.
  - The learner must register for the NPTEL exam using the @ds.study.iitm.ac.in Email ID.
  - The learner has to register for NPTEL exams, pay the exam fee, and complete the NPTEL course.
  - An NPTEL course can be transferred for credit only once and only to one program. The learner has to give an undertaking that they are submitting this course for credit transfer only to the IITM BS Degree program.
  - The NPTEL courses will be added in PASS/FAIL mode and counted towards the credits with no letter grade and will not be included in the CGPA calculation.
  - The fee for credit transfer from NPTEL courses is fixed as Rs 1000/- per credit. Hence, Rs 1000/-, Rs 2000/-, Rs 3000/- should be remitted as fees if a learner opts for credit transfer from NPTEL courses of duration 4/8/12 weeks. This fee is to be paid to the BS degree program, and is separate from the fee to be paid to NPTEL to complete the course.
  - The learner can complete NPTEL courses any time after joining the Foundation Level (using the official IITM email) and apply for the course credit transfer in the BSc/BS levels.
  - Refer the below table to know which term NPTEL courses can be transferred to which term in BS
  - Students are required to pay the RKA fee if they are only doing a credit transfer in a term.

| NPTEL courses completed in below term | Credit Transfer to BS Program in Term |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| January                              | September                             |
| July                                 | January                               |

### Credit Transfer from courses that are conducted on IITM campus (**This will be in effect from January 2024**)

- A maximum of 24 credits can be earned from any campus courses.
- 24 Graded [from on campus courses of IITM], 24 non graded credits allowed [apprenticeship, other institute, NPTEL]. MS (approve / reject) 28 credits [Theory (16 credits) + Apprenticeship (12 credits)] allowed. 3 campus credits (from IITM) = 1 BS credit.
- Students who have completed the foundation and the 2 diplomas and have CGPA of >=8 will be eligible to earn credits from campus courses.
- The maximum number of credits that can be taken at the BSc level will be 8. These credits are to be obtained from the Engineering, Science or Management departments.
- Students who have completed 114 credits in the IITM BS program and completed the BSc level with a CGPA of >=8 will be permitted to credit 24-x credits at the BS level where x is the number of credits they have earned in the BSc level from IITM campus courses.
- A maximum of 8 credits can be transferred from the HS category in the BS level, including the HS category credits earned through NPTEL.
- IITM BS students can apply to courses they are interested in and their acceptance will be based on the availability of seats for the course.
- The fees for transferring the credits from each on-campus course will be Rs 2500/- per credit of IITM BS program. The fee to be paid to the institute will be apart from this and will be as per the institute norms.
- Students will have to attend the class in person unless a hybrid mode of accessing the classes is available.
- The on-campus courses credited by the BS students will be listed in the transcript along with the corresponding grades.

### Applicable for the student who completed 142 credits:

- Once a student completes 142 credits in term X and has not started any CGPA or credit-earning courses in or before Term X, they will not be permitted to register any further in the program and their BS degree certificate will be processed.

**Case 2:** If a student completes 142 credits in Term X and has started any CGPA or credit-earning courses in or before Term X, they will have two options:

**Case 2a:** If the student chooses to complete the BS in term X and receive the certificate, the CGPA or credit-earning courses will not be listed on the BS transcript.

**Case 2b:** If the student opts to receive the BS certificate only when the additional components such as apprenticeship or other campus courses are completed, then the BS transcript will include the credits for these also and the BS certificate will be generated after this.

> Note: IITM Campus Courses are counted towards CGPA while apprenticeships and on-campus courses from other institutes are counted only for credits and not CGPA.

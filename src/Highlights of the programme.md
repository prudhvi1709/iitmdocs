Courses are taught by faculty of IIT Madras/other reputed institutes as well as experts from the industry.

Unlike many competitive admission exams which work on the philosophy of elimination and selection and admit a very limited number of learners into various programmes based on their performance relative to that of others, in this programme there are specific qualifying criteria,  and a significantly large number of learners can enter.

Learners of any background, be it engineering, sciences, humanities, arts, medicine, law, etc can attempt and join this programme.

There is no limitation on the age of the learner or their geographical location.

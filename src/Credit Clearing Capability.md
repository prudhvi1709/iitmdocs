## Course Registration Limit: Value S and Credit Clearing Capability (CCC)

---

### **Term-wise Calculation of Value S**

The **value S** is used to determine the **maximum number of courses** a learner is allowed to register for in a term.

#### Term-wise logic:

- **Term 1**: Based on **qualifier marks**
- **Term 2**: Based on **average marks of all courses passed in Term 1**
- **Term n (n>2)**: M = average marks of courses passed in the previous two terms Term n-1 and Term n-2  (This will be calculated using marks of subjects in which the candidate has passed, not those which he/she has not passed or is not completed yet); (n-1 and n-2 terms must be terms where the learner status is Active - defined in section [11 Learner Life Cycle](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRxGnnDCVAO3KX2CGtMIcJQuDrAasVk2JHbDxkjsGrTP5ShhZK8N6ZSPX89lexKx86QPAUswSzGLsOA/pub?urp=gmail_link#h.f1n87ris0g8p))

### **Mapping of Marks (M) to Maximum Course Load (S)**

| Marks `M` Range         | Max Courses Allowed |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| 0 <= M < 50             | 2                   |
| 50 <= M < 70            | 3                   |
| M >= 70                 | 4                   |

### **Credit Clearing Capability (CCC)**

The credit clearing capability CCC will be decided as follows:

- If a learner has passed at least one course in term n-1, then the CCC of term n will be calculated based on the marks as given in the above table.
- If a learner has failed all courses the learner has appeared for in term n-1, CCC of next term n will be 2.
- If a learner is absent for final exam of all courses, thus not completing their courses and not getting grades, CCC of next term = CCC of the learnerâ€™s last term

CCC is kept as 4 by default for

- everyone who chooses to register to courses in the same term as the qualifier exam
- For all JEE candidates in the first term
- For everyone in the Diploma and Degree levels

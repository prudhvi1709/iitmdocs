## 20.2 Examination and Fee Structure

- **Exam Schedule**: Exams will be conducted on the scheduled final exam date of a term.  
- **Passing Requirement**: To be eligible for continuation, students must appear for the final exam in all the subjects relevant to their readmission, as listed above.  
- **Academic Continuation**:  
  - Students may register for the next-level courses irrespective of their performance in the readmission exams. However, attendance is mandatory.  
  - If a student scores less than 50% in any subject, that subject will be added to their academic load and treated as a pending course; Such courses will not be counted to the credits earned. The 50% cut-off is the same across all categories of students.

## 20.3 Post-Readmission Academic and Administrative Processes

Upon readmission, the following policies apply:

- **Student Roll Number**: Remains unchanged from the student’s original enrollment.  
- **Progress Card and Grade Card**:  
  - Only courses undertaken after readmission will be listed in the progress and grade cards provided after readmission. The courses done that were counted towards the previous Original Certificate will not be listed in this.  
  - Courses cleared through mandatory re-admission exams will be shown as completed but not counted for credits in the program.  
  - The status called “Lateral Entry” will be mentioned in both the Progress and Grade card to make it clear that the student had exited at some level with the Original Certificate and had chosen to re-enter at the next level.  
- **Certificates**:  
  - **Provisional Certificate**: No changes in process  
  - **Original Certificate**: The previously issued Original Certificate need not be returned to the institute.  
- **Time Limit and Term Break**:  
  - There is no restriction on when a student may apply for re-admission.  
  - The duration of the term(s) between exit and re-entry will be excluded from the overall program time limit. After accounting for this exclusion, all other time limit constraints of the overall program apply.  
  - A formal Readmission Letter will be issued to the student once the re-entry into the program is approved.

# Flexibility

There are two entry and four exit points, with learners being able to exit with either course certificates, or diploma or the degree. Learners can choose their pace of study every term. Being an online programme, there is no geographical barrier to learning from this programme - learners only need to travel to exam centres for exams each term.

**IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE: This programme is NOT BASED on an admission process.  Qualified learners can attempt respective stages of the programme and those who clear each stage will receive the certificate corresponding to that stage alone.**


So, for example, the learner should be aware that they are not being admitted to a degree programme after the Qualifier. It is only for the set of Foundation courses, which on successful completion makes them eligible to enter the Diploma level. The diplomas or degrees are obtained by the candidate only when the requisite number of credits are accrued by completing the courses prescribed and satisfying any other mandatory criteria.

Admission to any level does not automatically entitle the learner to exit the programme with the Diploma or the degree.

Students who are continuing with the program will go through the following steps to sign up for the courses:

- Within the registration window, students will pick the courses they want to take in the coming term, with limiting criteria on total courses registered being their CCC i.e learners can register to maximum number of courses <= their CCC.
- Students pick 2 cities among the choices provided for their quizzes and exams for that term.
- They have the freedom to choose a different set of cities than the ones they opted for in the previous terms.
- Also they can choose a different set of cities for every quiz/final exam while registering for the courses so that accordingly booking may be done with the Exam vendor for slots in these cities.

Once a learner clears the qualifier, he/she will be eligible to register for the Foundation level. Using their personal email id, they register to as many courses as permitted by CCC and make the payment. After approval of the uploaded documents, the learner is given a roll_number@ds.study.iitm.ac.in email id.

Henceforth all interactions on the portal right from login to accessing the learner dashboard and courses will be via this email id.

### There will be 5 statuses for any learner in the programme:

- **On the rolls/Active**
- **On Academic Probation**
- **Struck off the rolls**
- **Alumnus**
- **Quit the programme**

---

#### On the rolls/Active
- When a learner is registered in any term for one or more courses after paying the course fees, the status will be “On the rolls” or Active.

#### On Academic Probation / Not registering to any course in a term
- After joining the programme, a learner may skip up to 2 terms consecutively without taking any courses.
- In the two terms where the learner does not register for any course, the learner status will be marked as “On Academic Probation”.
- The learner email ID will still be kept alive while the learner is on academic probation.

- The learner can actively inform us about not registering to courses by paying the “Registration keep alive fee (RKA)” of Rs 1000/- per term.
- In case of registering to courses in the next term, the learners have to only pay the course fees.
- The learner may not pay the RKA and have it as pending to be paid.
- Pending RKA will include 10% extra over regular RKA when re-registering back.
- To register to courses in the next term if not paid the RKA:
  - The learner will have to pay the pending dues = Rs 1100/- or Rs 2200/-  
    (Rs 1000 RKA + 10% as penalty for each term where no courses are registered)
  - The learner has to select the courses and pay the course fees.
  - Once they do this, the learner status is changed to "On the rolls".

#### Struck off the rolls
- If a learner with status “On Academic Probation” for 2 consecutive terms does not register for courses in the next term too, the learner’s status is changed to "Struck off the rolls".
- The official email id is suspended.

**To reactivate the registration:**
- If the RKA for the previous 3 terms has already been paid:
  - They have to request for reactivating the email id on payment of Re-admission fee of Rs 2500/-
  - Once done, they can register for the courses in the upcoming term

- If the RKA for the previous 3 terms has not been paid:
  - The learner has to apply to activate his/her account by paying the pending dues which will be Rs 5800/-  
    = Rs 2500 (Readmission fee) + Rs 3300/- (Rs 1000 RKA x 3 terms + Rs 300 (10% as penalty))
  - On receipt of the payment, the official email id is activated again and they are permitted to register using this id.
  - Once they do this, the status is changed to "On the rolls"

- Any learner who is struck off the rolls **2 times**, is **removed from the programme**

#### Quitting the programme
- There will also be an option inside the candidate dashboard which says **"I quit the programme"**
- Once the learner applies for this midway through a level:
  - We suspend the official email account
  - Activate the personal email account to access the dashboard
  - No reactivation for continuing the program is possible

#### Alumnus
- Learners who complete the BSc level / BS level and quit the program:
  - The official email id is suspended
  - Personal email account is activated to access the dashboard
  - Status will be changed to **“Alumnus”**

> Students completing the foundation or diploma level and quitting the programme will have status as:
> - **“FL certified”**
> - **“DS certified” / “DP certified” / “Both diplomas certified”**
> - But will **not** be awarded the **Alumnus** status.
